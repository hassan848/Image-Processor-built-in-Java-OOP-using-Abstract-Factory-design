# Image-Processor-built-in-Java-OOP-using-Abstract-Factory-design
This is my Java Image Processor application which can be used to select an Image and apply different operations to them, such as tinting, blending it with another image, chroma key etc. Built using Factory &amp; OOP design.
To run the Application, locate the 'imageProcessor' class with the main method and run it.
